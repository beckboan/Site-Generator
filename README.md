# Static Site Generator

This is a simple static site generator built with python. It takes Markdown files and converts them into a static HTML website. The goal of this project was to create a simple, lightweight tool for generating static sites from Markdown files from scratch. This includes all of the HTML, CSS, and image files needed to render the site.

## Features

- Converts Markdown to HTML
- Supports nested content directories
- Allows for custom CSS and images
- Recursive generation of multi-page sites
- Simple viewing of generated site on localhost

## To Do
1. Add support for double-nested elements
2. Fix code block/element rendering

## Installation

Ensure you have python3 installed on your system. Test with `python3 --version`. If you don't have it installed, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beckboan/static-site-generator.git
cd static-site-generator
./main.zsh
```

## Usage/Customization
1. Create a new directory in the `content` directory.
2. Add a markdown file to the new directory.
